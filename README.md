#Samurai

Each image represents the color palette from one episode of [Samurai Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Jack). I took one screen shot per second, then took the 20 most common colors in each screenshot, and aggregated those colors into images. See comments in [samurai.py](samurai.py) for more details.
